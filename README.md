## Features

Swan Provider listens to offline deals that come from the Swan platform. It provides the following functions:

* Download offline deals automatically using aria2 for downloading service.
* Publish `PublishStorageDeals`messages, moves funds from collateral wallet into escrow with the StorageMarketActor(when set `Market_version=1.2`)
* Import deals using Market(version=1.1 and 1.2) once the download is completed.
* Synchronize deal status to [Swan Platform](https://console.filswan.com/#/dashboard), so that both clients and storage providers will know the status changes in realtime.
* Auto-bid task from FilSwan bidding market.
* Get the manual-bid tasks from FilSwan Platform.

## Prerequisite
- Lotus-miner
- Aria2 Service

#### Start Lotus-miner
Before launching the `swan-provider`, you must ensure that `Lotus-miner` is running normally. and `Lotus-miner` token is necessary for importing deals.
```shell
lotus-miner auth create-token --perm write
```
Note that the `Lotus-miner` needs to be running in the background!
The created token is located at `$LOTUS_MINER_PATH/token`
Reference: [Lotus: API tokens](https://lotus.filecoin.io/reference/basics/api-access/)

#### Aria2 Service
```shell
sudo apt install aria2
```

## Installation
You can set the `$SWAN_PATH` by the environment variable, default `~/.swan`:

```shell
export SWAN_PATH="/data/.swan"
```

### Option:one: **Prebuilt package**: See [release assets](https://github.com/filswan/go-swan-provider/releases)
####  Build Instructions
```shell
wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/filswan/go-swan-provider/release-2.2.0-rc1/install.sh
chmod +x ./install.sh
./install.sh
```
#### Config and Run
- Edit config file **~/.swan/provider/config.toml**, configuration instruction is [here](#Configuration-and-Run)
- Run `swan-provider` in the background

```
ulimit -SHn 1048576
export SWAN_PATH="/data/.swan"
nohup swan-provider-2.2.0-rc1-linux-amd64 daemon >> swan-provider.log 2>&1 & 
```
### Option:two: Source Code
Building the `swan-provider` requires some system dependencies:
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
```
```
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
```
sudo apt install mesa-opencl-icd ocl-icd-opencl-dev gcc git bzr jq pkg-config curl clang build-essential hwloc libhwloc-dev wget -y && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
- Go(required **1.18.1+**)
```
wget -c https://golang.org/dl/go1.18.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz -O - | sudo tar -xz -C /usr/local
```
```
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```
- Rustup
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

####  Build Instructions
```shell
git clone https://github.com/filswan/go-swan-provider.git
cd go-swan-provider
git checkout release-2.2.0-rc1
./build_from_source.sh
```

## Configuration and Run

The configuration needs to be set according to the different `market_version`.
```
port = 8888
release = true                                  # when working in release mode: set this to true, otherwise to false and environment variable GIN_MODE not to release

client_api_token = ""                           # Access token of lotus client web API. (lotus auth api-info --perm=admin)
market_api_url = "http://[ip]:[port]/rpc/v0"   	# Url of lotus market web API, generally the [port] is 2345, when market and miner are not separate, it is also the URL of miner web API
market_access_token = ""                        # Access token of lotus market web API, when market and miner are not separate, it is also the access token of miner web API

```
**(1) when `market_version = "1.1"`**, the storage provider will import deals using the Market built-in lotus, so the `[market]` section is not necessary to set.


**(2) when `market_version = "1.2"`**, the storage provider will import deals using the Market like `Boost`, so you must ensure the storage provider is reachable. The following steps are:

- Disable the markets subsystem in miner config:
```
vi $LOTUS_MINER_PATH/config.toml
```
```
[Subsystems] 
 EnableMarkets = false
```
- Config the `[market]` section in the `$SWAN_PATH/provider/config.toml`
- Initialize the Market repo to the `$SWAN_PATH/provider/boost`:
```
export SWAN_PATH="/data/.swan"
swan-provider daemon 
```
- Config the `[Libp2p]` section

	(1) Ensure that the `swan-provider` and `boostd` are not running

	```
	kill -9 $(ps -ef | grep -E 'swan-provider|boostd' | grep -v grep | awk '{print$2}' )
	```
	(2) Edit the boost configuration in the `$SWAN_PATH/boost/config.toml`:
	```
	[Libp2p]
  	  ListenAddresses = ["/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/24001", "/ip6/::/tcp/24001"]   # Binding address for the libp2p host
      AnnounceAddresses = ["/ip4/209.94.92.3/tcp/24001"]                  # Addresses to explicitly announce to other peers. If not specified, all interface addresses are announced
	```
	(3) Run `swan-provider` in the background.
	```
	ulimit -SHn 1048576
	export SWAN_PATH="/data/.swan"
	nohup swan-provider daemon >> swan-provider.log 2>&1 & 
	```
 - Publish Storage Provider's Multiaddrs and PeerID:
 	- Acquired from `boostd --boost-repo=$SWAN_PATH/provider/boost net listen`
 	```
 	lotus-miner actor set-addrs /ip4/<ip>/tcp/<port>   
 	```
  	- Acquired from `boostd --boost-repo=$SWAN_PATH/provider/boost net id`
 	```
 	lotus-miner actor set-peer-id <PeerID> 
 	```
 - Set the storage provider's ask
 ```
 export SWAN_PATH="/data/.swan"
 swan-provider set-ask --price=0 --verified-price=0 --min-piece-size=1048576 --max-piece-size=34359738368
 ```
 - Set the `[market].publish_wallet` as a control address:
 ```
 export OLD_CONTROL_ADDRESS=`lotus-miner actor control list  --verbose | awk '{print $3}' | grep -v key | tr -s '\n'  ' '`
 ```
 ```
 lotus-miner actor control set --really-do-it $[market].publish_wallet $OLD_CONTROL_ADDRESS
 ```
 - Add funds to the `collateral_wallet` Market Actor
 ```
 lotus wallet market add --from=<YOUR_WALLET> --address=<collateral_wallet> <amount>
 ```

## Interact with the Swan Provider
The `swan-provider` command allows you to interact with a running swan provider daemon.
Check the current version of your swan-provider
```
swan-provider version
```
## Common issues and solutions
* My aria is not downloaded

  Please check if aria2 is running
  ```shell
  ps -ef | grep aria2
  ```

* error msg="no response from swan platform‚Äù

  Please check your `api_url` is correct, it should be `https://go-swan-server.filswan.com`
